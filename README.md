## Ghibli-Style Tree in Three.js

This project creates a Ghibli-style tree using Three.js, a popular JavaScript library for 3D graphics. The tree model was initially created in Blender and exported as a GLB file, which was then imported into JavaScript to create the Ghibli-style tree effect.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

## Clone the repository to your local machine:
Copy code
git clone 


## Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:
npm install or yarn install


## Run the project locally:
bash
Copy code
npm start or yarn start

## View 
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the Ghibli-style tree in action.

## Usage
The Ghibli-style tree can be used in your own projects by importing the Tree component and customizing it as needed. Here's an example of how to use it in your React application:

`javascript`
import React from "react";
import Tree from "./Tree";
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Tree colors={[0x49897C, 0x050505, 0xFFFFFF, 0x808080]} />
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;




In this example, the colors prop is passed to the Tree component, allowing you to customize the tree's appearance.

## Customization
You can customize the Ghibli-style tree by adjusting various parameters in the shaders and the Tree component:

Shader Parameters: You can modify the appearance of the tree by tweaking the parameters in the GhibliShader located in the shaders/ghibliShader.js file. This includes adjusting colors, lighting, and brightness thresholds.

Tree Position and Scale: You can change the position and scale of the tree by modifying the position and scale properties in the Tree component in your React application.

Tree Model: If you want to use a different tree model, you can replace the trees.glb file in the assets directory with your own GLB model. Ensure that your model is properly exported with materials.

## Credits
This project uses the Three.js library for 3D rendering. You can find more information about Three.js here.

The Ghibli-style shader is inspired by the art style of Studio Ghibli films.
